# dotfiles
My dotfiles and other configuration files.

Contains various configuration files as well as my custom zsh theme (which adds user@machine 
and the time to the right side of the command line).

There is also a shell script called 'setup.sh', which can automatically setup the dotfiles on a new machine (or
update them on a machine where they are already set up). See the script file for more information.
